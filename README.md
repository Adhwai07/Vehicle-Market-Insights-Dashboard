# Vehicle-Market-Insights-Dashboard
An interactive dashboard providing a data-driven look at 2014-2015 U.S. and Canadian car sales. The project transforms raw sales data into actionable insights on market share, revenue streams, and dealership success through compelling visual analytics.

# Introduction & Dataset Overview
This Power BI project analyzes U.S. used car sales to help sales executives and brand managers uncover key market trends, identify top-performing models, and understand regional demand patterns. The dashboard focuses on sales activity between 2014 and 2015, offering a dynamic and interactive way to explore sales performance by model, body type, dealership location, and more.

The original dataset contained approximately 548,537 records, which was reduced to 548,077 after a careful data cleaning process. The dataset includes details such as make and model, VIN number, body type, selling price, trim, dealership state, and the sale date.

# Data Cleaning & Preparation
To ensure accurate and reliable insights, extensive data cleaning and preparation were performed on the original dataset containing over 548,500 records. After cleaning, the dataset was refined to approximately 548,077 high-quality records ready for analysis.

Key data cleaning steps included:

- Standardizing inconsistent entries: Variations in vehicle makes such as “Ford Pickups” and “Dodge Pickups” were consolidated to their respective brands, “Ford” and “Dodge,” ensuring consistency in grouping and analysis.
- Handling color data: Ambiguous or unclear values in the exterior and interior color columns were replaced with “Undefined” to maintain data integrity while acknowledging missing or uncertain information.
- Correcting typographical errors: Typos and inconsistent naming conventions in various categorical fields (e.g., model names like “q60 Coupe” vs. “Q60 Coupe”) were standardized for clarity.

- Converting date fields: The saledate column, originally stored as a complex text string (e.g., "Tue Dec 16 2014 12:30:00 GMT-0800 (PST)"), was cleaned and converted into a proper date format through targeted string manipulation and parsing in Power Query, enabling accurate time-based analysis.

- Filtering by VIN: Only records with a 17-character Vehicle Identification Number (VIN) were retained, adhering to industry standards and ensuring data validity.

- Removing incomplete records: Entries missing a sale date were excluded from the dataset to prevent inaccuracies in chronological reporting and ensure trustworthy sales metrics.

- All these transformations were performed using Power Query within Power BI, leveraging its powerful data shaping, cleaning, and transformation features to streamline the process and maintain a reproducible workflow.

- These cleaning steps laid the groundwork for a robust and insightful Power BI dashboard, providing a dependable foundation for exploring trends, sales performance, and customer preferences.
