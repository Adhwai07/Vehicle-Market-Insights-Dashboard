# Vehicle-Market-Insights-Dashboard
An interactive dashboard providing a data-driven look at 2014-2015 U.S. and Canadian car sales. The project transforms raw sales data into actionable insights on market share, revenue streams, and dealership success through compelling visual analytics.

# Introduction & Dataset Overview
This Power BI project analyzes U.S. car sales to help sales executives and brand managers uncover key market trends, identify top-performing models, and understand regional demand patterns. The dashboard focuses on sales activity between 2014 and 2015, offering a dynamic and interactive way to explore sales performance by model, body type, dealership location, and more.

The original dataset contained approximately approximately 548,500 records, which was refined to 548,077 after cleaning. The dataset includes details such as make and model, VIN number, body type, selling price, trim, dealership state, and the sale date.

# Data Cleaning & Preparation
To ensure accurate and reliable insights, extensive data cleaning and preparation were performed on the original dataset containing over 548,500 records. After cleaning, the dataset was refined to approximately 548,077 high-quality records ready for analysis.

Key data cleaning steps included:

- Standardizing inconsistent entries: Variations in vehicle makes such as “Ford Pickups” and “Dodge Pickups” were consolidated to their respective brands, “Ford” and “Dodge,” ensuring consistency in grouping and analysis.
- Handling color data: Ambiguous or unclear values in the exterior and interior color columns were replaced with “Undefined” to maintain data integrity while acknowledging missing or uncertain information.
- Correcting typographical errors: Typos and inconsistent naming conventions in various categorical fields (e.g., model names like “q60 Coupe” vs. “Q60 Coupe”) were standardized for clarity.

- Converting date fields: The saledate column, originally stored as a complex text string (e.g., "Tue Dec 16 2014 12:30:00 GMT-0800 (PST)"), was cleaned and converted into a proper date format through targeted string manipulation and parsing in Power Query, enabling accurate time-based analysis.

- Filtering by VIN: Only records with a 17-character Vehicle Identification Number (VIN) were retained, adhering to industry standards and ensuring data validity.

- Removing incomplete records: Entries missing a sale date were excluded from the dataset to prevent inaccuracies in chronological reporting and ensure trustworthy sales metrics.

- All these transformations were performed using Power Query within Power BI, leveraging its powerful data shaping, cleaning, and transformation features to streamline the process and maintain a reproducible workflow.

- These cleaning steps laid the groundwork for a robust and insightful Power BI dashboard, providing a dependable foundation for exploring trends, sales performance, and customer preferences.

- Regional Variation in Preferences:

   While most top states were sedan-dominated, Texas displayed a notable preference for pickups, where the Ford F-150 was the highest-selling model with around 2K units, surpassing even the popular Altima.
  Georgia also showed regional variation, with the F-150 ranking third in overall sales — an exception to the sedan-heavy trends in other states.

- Model-Level Insights – Nissan Altima Drillthrough:
  As the top-selling model, the Nissan Altima was analyzed in greater detail to uncover deeper patterns in customer preferences and dealership performance:
  
  -  The total revenue generated by Altima sales exceeded $221 million, underlining its significant contribution to the overall market.
    
  - Color Preferences:
    The most popular exterior and interior color combination was black, reflecting a classic and widely preferred choice among buyers.
    
  - Top Dealerships by Sales Volume:

    - 3.5 SE – 399
    
    - 2.5 SL – 398
    
    - 3.5 SL – 292
      
    The preference for lower trims indicates a consumer trend toward affordability and practicality over premium features.
    
  - Transmission Type:
    An overwhelming 99% of Altima sales featured automatic transmission, reinforcing the widespread consumer shift away from manual vehicles in this segment.
    
  - Model Year Distribution:
    
    - The 2012 model year dominated, representing 43% of all Altima sales.
      
    - 2013 followed with 27%, and 2014 accounted for just over 10%.
      
    These results may reflect a combination of value retention, favorable pricing, and availability in the secondary market for earlier model years.

## Broader Market Context & Strategic Implications
1. How does the sales performance of this model compare to its competitors in the same segment or price range?

- Within the sedan category, the Nissan Altima clearly leads by over 6,000 units, ahead of its closest rival, the Ford Fusion.
  
- This dominance is supported by the 2012 Altima's reputation for fuel efficiency, reliability, and stable resale value, making it an ideal used-car choice in the 2014–2015 market.
  
- In contrast, the 2012 Ford Fusion was hurt by the launch of the redesigned 2013 model, which made the older version look dated. Additionally, transmission and power steering concerns further weakened its appeal.
  
- For buyers prioritizing value, familiarity, and low cost of ownership, the Altima was the safer, more attractive bet.

2. Do customer preferences vary significantly by region or dealership (e.g., SUV vs. sedan preferences in different states)?

- Yes, customer preferences vary considerably by region, driven by economic, geographic, and cultural factors.
  
- In Texas, pickup trucks like the Ford F-150 dominate due to their utility in agriculture, oil, and construction industries, and because of their cultural symbolism.
  
- In contrast, urbanized states like California, Florida, and Pennsylvania show a stronger preference for sedans and compact SUVs due to dense traffic, limited parking, fuel economy considerations, and lower ownership costs.
  
- This explains why the Altima thrived in non-rural states, especially in areas where cost, reliability, and fuel efficiency matter more than hauling capability.

This conclusion positions the Altima not only as a high-performing model in absolute terms, but also as one that outperforms key competitors due to smart positioning in the used market. Furthermore, it highlights how regional customer needs shape the automotive landscape—a crucial insight for inventory planning, dealership strategy, and targeted marketing.

# Limitations
- Incomplete Monthly Data: A significant limitation of the dataset is the absence of sales data for several months, notably from August to November, which creates blind spots when analyzing seasonality or monthly sales trends.
  
- Limited Time Frame: The dataset only includes sales data from 2014 and 2015, restricting long-term trend analysis and making it difficult to assess sustained model performance or market evolution over time.
  
- Lack of Certain Features: Important vehicle characteristics such as number of cylinders, number of doors, or detailed feature packages are not present in the dataset. This limits the depth of analysis on how specific vehicle configurations may impact sales.
  
- No Customer or Marketing Data: The dataset doesn't include customer demographics, dealership marketing efforts, or advertising campaigns, which are often key drivers in sales and could offer richer context behind spikes or drops in performance.

# Future Enhancements
- Feature Expansion: Adding new fields such as number of doors, engine cylinders, drivetrain type, and fuel type could allow for a more granular analysis of what specific car features influence customer purchase decisions.
  
- Regional Economic and Demographic Enrichment: Incorporating external data like regional income levels, fuel prices, or population density could provide valuable context behind geographic variations in sales.
  
- Predictive Modeling: Implementing predictive analytics techniques—such as regression models, time series forecasting, or classification models—could help forecast future sales, identify key sales drivers, or predict buyer preferences for different trims or features.
  
- Competitor Analysis Module: Extending the dashboard to include side-by-side comparisons with competing models using market share data or resale values would deepen the business relevance of the insights.
  
- Customer Segmentation: If user-level data becomes available in the future, performing segmentation based on buying behavior could uncover targeted sales strategies for different customer profiles.
